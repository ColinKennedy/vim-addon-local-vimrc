configuration, these are defaults:
let g:local_vimrc = {'names':['.localrc'],'hash_fun':'LVRHashOfFile'}

Features:
- When Vim starts up current directory up to root is traversed and special
  files such as .local-vimrc files are sourced

- For security reasons a checksum is calculated before doing so. You're asked
  for confirmation only if that changes.

KISS: If you need filetype support write au commands into the local vimrc.

Yes I know that there are already a couple of existing similar plugins.
But I they work for filetypes only (why?) and they don't verify file contents.
