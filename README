configuration, these are defaults:
let g:local_vimrc = {'names':['.localrc'],'hash_fun':'LVRHashOfFile'}

Features:
- When Vim starts up current directory up to root is traversed and special
  files such as .local-vimrc files are sourced

- For security reasons a checksum is calculated before doing so. You're asked
  for confirmation only if that changes.


Sample RC
=========

augroup LOCAL_SETUP
  " using vim-addon-sql providing alias aware SQL completion for .sql files and PHP:
  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.sql,*.php call vim_addon_sql#Connect('mysql',{'database':'DATABASE', 'user':'USER', 'password' : 'PASSWORD'})

  " for php use tab as indentation character. Display a tab as 4 spaces:
  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.php set noexpandtab| set tabstop=4 | set sw=4

  " hint: for indentation settings modelines can be an alternative as well as
  " various plugins trying to set vim's indentation based on file contents.
augroup end


KISS: If you need filetype support write au commands into the local vimrc.

Yes I know that there are already a couple of existing similar plugins.
But I they work for filetypes only (why?) and they don't verify file contents.
